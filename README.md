Boards fits in [v.3 Stick Case](https://github.com/mercenaruss/zigbee-stick-v4/tree/main/files/STL) designed by [Jager](https://github.com/Jager-f)

## Revisions

There are 2 versions of stick:
- [CH340E version](https://github.com/mercenaruss/zigbee-stick-v4/blob/main/files/gerber/Gerber_Zigbee%20Stick%20v4.0%20-%20CH340E.zip), more compact,all elements on one side.
- [CH340C version](https://github.com/mercenaruss/zigbee-stick-v4/blob/main/files/gerber/Gerber_Zigbee%20Stick%20v4.0%20-%20CH340C.zip), more easy to solder and includes ESD protection.

Both versions use the same [3D Model Case](/files/STL)
